In this project I build 3 different solidity smart contracts and deployed them on the Ropsten Test Network. The smart contracts were designed to immitate a company offering an ESOP that the employees could vest into. These contracts required rules to ensure they followed the accounting rules and regulatory guidelines in place.

## `TieredProfitSplitter`
